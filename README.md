# whereuatngwapi
This project is ported over from a Node.js project that did server side rendering for the front-end. This project uses Angular to render the front-end. Not all functionality had been ported, such as the google maps view to show locations. This project does not illustrate clean code as it was largely thrown together in a limited time window before two vacations.
